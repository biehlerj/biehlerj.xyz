```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

For this project I am using the [experimental assets support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/assets/) for images.

This website also uses the [content collections API](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to easily manage and configure entries for things like my education, projects I've worked on, etc. All subdirectory in `src/content/` holds items that are all similar and then are used by the `[..slug].astro` file in the corresponding directory in `src/pages/`.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                            |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm install`         | Installs dependencies                             |
| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`       |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`           |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying      |
| `pnpm sync`            | Generates TypeScript types for all Astro modules. |
| `pnpm astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check`  |
| `pnpm astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                      |

## Roadmap

There is still more work to be done in this repo before it replaces the current [biehlerj.xyz](https://biehlerj.xyz). Below is a non-exhaustive list of things that are planned which includes things that will be done after this code base takes over as [biehlerj.xyz](https://biehlerj.xyz):

- ~~Use Tailwind CSS to make the site look beautiful~~ Added in [v0.2.0](https://github.com/biehlerj/biehlerj.xyz/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

- ~~Improve the navigation in pages:~~ Added in [v0.3.0](https://github.com/biehlerj/biehlerj.xyz/releases/tag/v0.3.0)
  - ~~Have content pages have a button to go back to the landing page for that content collection~~
  - ~~Tag skills for all content collections (where applicable):~~
    - ~~Use tags to allow users to search through my skills and how much, when, and where I used/learned them~~
- Create a blog:
  - Make tags for blog posts that are separate from tags for skills
  - Create a CMS to make uploading new posts easy
